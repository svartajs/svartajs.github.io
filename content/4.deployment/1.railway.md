# Railway

[Live URL](https://hellosvarta.up.railway.app/)

[Repository](https://github.com/svartajs/svarta/tree/main/examples/minimal-railway-docker)

---

Let's setup a simple web server on [Railway](https://railway.app/) using Docker.

## Create repository

Create a new GitHub repository.

Clone the repository locally. In the folder, run:

::code-group

```bash [terminal]
pnpm create svarta-app
```

::

## (Optional) Adjust your project

Create or change routes as required. To run the development server, run:

::code-group

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm dev
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn dev
```

```bash [npm]
npm run dev
```

::

When you're done, it's time to deploy the app!

## Deploy to railway

First, make sure your changes are pushed to GitHub.

Then, create a new project (https://railway.app/new), select `Deploy from GitHub repo`.

Select your GitHub repository and click `Deploy now`.

Your app should build now.

To view it online, go to `Settings` and generate a domain.

After a couple of seconds, your app should be reachable under that URL.
