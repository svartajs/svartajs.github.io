Let's setup a simple web server on [fly.io](https://fly.io/) using Docker.

## Setup fly.io

1. Create a fly.io account
2. Make sure the `flyctl` CLI tool is installed

Check out the [fly.io Docs](https://fly.io/docs/hands-on/install-flyctl/) for more information
::

## Setup web server

Now setup a new HTTP web server using:

::code-group

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm create svarta-app
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn create svarta-app
```

```bash [npm]
npm create svarta-app
```

::

And follow the in-terminal instructions. Select the `starter-http` template.

The template comes with a Dockerfile, so we're almost ready to go. Just one thing:

In `svarta.config.mjs` change `defaultPort` to `8080` (the default for fly.io). Else, you could change the port by using the `PORT` or `SVARTA_PORT` environment variables.

## (Optional) Adjust your project

Create or change routes as required. To run the development server, run:

::code-group

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm dev
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn dev
```

```bash [npm]
npm run dev
```

::

When you're done, it's time to deploy the app!

## Create fly.io app

::code-group

```bash [terminal]
flyctl launch
```

::

flyctl will detect the Dockerfile. Go through the setup and then deploy using:

## Deploy to fly.io

::code-group

```bash [terminal]
flyctl deploy
```

::

Wait for the docker image to deploy, then your API will deployed on \[app-name\].fly.dev.
